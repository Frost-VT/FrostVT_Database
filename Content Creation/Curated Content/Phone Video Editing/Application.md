This is where I'll figure out what application I'll be using to video edit using my phone! ^^

What video editing tools exist on the phone? This will be a generally lower quality guide since it's going to be a faster-paced learning, as a race to MVP for a commission.

1. Inshot
2. Power director
3. Capcut
4. YouCut
5. Edits
6. ~~Adobe Premiere Rush~~ (I prefer not to use an Adobe product if I can help it.)

So I installed 5 apps, that should be plenty.

I'll try to use each of them to accomplish the same workflow of 

1. Remove silence
2. Add nice captions
3. Toss an emoji in there
4. Some panning and camera movement 

Bonus: Auto-captions that can be edited in post
