A generalization of the lessons taught by `Fair Fight` (https://www.youtube.com/@PointDown)  on their video, "How to learn Godot from videos instead of just watching them".

Tutorials often don't answer simple and isolated problems.
[Especially in Game Dev!]

If you're inefficient, you could:
 - Watch a video 20 times, consecutively
 - Watch a video 2-3 times, and just transcribing / paraphrasing it in notion / obsidian / mindmap / physical media etc.
 otherwise called "prayge learning" 
 (Context: The author comedically suggests that you are praying that hopefully the video will trickle down into your head as actual learning.)

Ofc, we don't know the perfect way to learn things, so like, do what you want. But this video exists to give us a framework to begin with.

# Fair Fight's Framework for Learning:

1. Reject Knowledge - Return to Monkey
	— to replicate the works of others
2. Hunt experience - by searching for practices
	— to organize the replication into repeatable practices, coupled with the reasoning. Like writing a book, or a tutorial.

| Practice | Do I fully understand what happened? | Category | Pros | Cons | Outcome | Alternative Ways | How I can apply it |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ | -------- | ---- | ---- | ------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
|          |                                      |          |      |      |         |                  |                    |
|          |                                      |          |      |      |         |                  |                    |
|          |                                      |          |      |      |         |                  |                    |
|          |                                      |          |      |      |         |                  |                    |
As a beginner, these practices should be a lot smaller and simpler.
As you learn, these should scale upwards.

The reason behind this is, without processing, our learnings tend to be scattered:

But as you learn things, you can make connections between learnings to make them more usable

Now, you'll be a lot more confident in what you've learned, and you'll be able to get to a solution much faster! ^^

So, what if you have only just started learning a skill and don't yet have those points to start working with?

1. Follow through a tutorial project [i.e structured learning]
2. Invent different ways to reach the same result [i.e, free learning]

In Godot, just like...click stuff. Right click stuff. Don't be afraid to experiment
*What. does. do. 
How? How change?*

**Frost's note:** Please try to figure stuff out using documentation. I need to make a video on how to learn documentation, because people are afraid of things.
