Obsidian uses markdown.
https://markdownguide.org/basic-syntax

So it has headings, checkboxes, lists, and the usual stuff.
It also has Graph View:
Here, groups were used to depict the files in some way

Putting the name of a file in double square brackets creates a link.

Notes can be tagged in two ways:
```
---
tags: research, web
---
```
   OR 
   with a hashtag 
   #obsidian

Two Extensions were suggested:
1. TagFolder -> Which lets you see tags as folders
2. DataView

With dataview, this is what they ran:
```dataview
TABLE
file.ctime as Created
FROM #obsidian 
SORT file.ctime DESC
LIMIT 10
```
