I can't imagine what Obsidian is capable of until I see how others use it.
It has an overwhelming amount of plugins. Some interfere with the others.

What I do know is — ONE DAY it shall serve as the basis for my website.

Here, I decided to make Unprocessed and Processed directly due to different content creators being relevant
