## License
**GNU GPLv3**. 

### Content Creation
I encourage sharing this, making videos, modifying, using it as a basis of your own notes, I'm happy to see people learn!

### What would bring me joy:
1. **Credit:** Please try to link this repo if you make videos or any kind of derivative work about it. 
> I will literally bake you cookies irl if you share any of my social medias and happen to be within cookie-giving range.
2. **Copyleft:** If you distribute a modified version of this software as part of your content, you must keep that version open-source under the same GPLv3 license.

I hope this brings you joy! ^^

Resources will typically be in this format:

	TOPIC [such as "Game Development" or "Coding"]

	    └── L1: Sub-Categories
	
			├── L2: 0_Learnings [Compiled ver. of processed stuff]
	
			└── L2: A folder for each Content Creator
	
				└── L3 "Processed" Folder
	
				└── L3: "Unprocessed" Folder
	
					└── L4 (for both):  The actual vids and texts

Any folder named "src" is where I'll keep any downloaded media relevant to the level it's in.

If "Sub-Categories" isn't a thing I can figure out, the entire directory structure shifts up a level. 
I won't be getting them right in my first go, but I'm certain that I'll get better at organizing them as we progress.
