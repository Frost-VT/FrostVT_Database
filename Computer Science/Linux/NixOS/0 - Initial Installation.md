A distro I've always wanted to look into has been NixOS. 

Now that I'm tracking everything, I think it'd be fun to explore this with all of you, and chronicle my journey through it.

My plan is to dual boot NixOS, and I have to install it to pull that off.

I've managed my first phone pull+push!

Hit a slight bump along the way, apparently obsidian-git doesn't support SSH so I had to auth through HTTPS, which was pretty easy! ^^

Just needed to throw a PAT in there.

Doing one check to ensure there's no funny business.

Here's the installation guide:

There are two steps:
1. Get something to write the Bootable OS onto a USB
	- I've used Rufus in the past
	- I'm using [USBWriter](https://sourceforge.net/projects/usbwriter/files/latest/download#) here to stick close to the guide

2.
